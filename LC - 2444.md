# Hi! Let's Learn

Prerequisites for this problem:
Q) What is the total number of subarrays between index ```start``` and index ```i``` that end at ```i```?
A) ```i-start+1```

Example : ```a = [1,2,3,4,5,6] ``` and ```start = 1``` and  ```i = 4``` then all subarrays ending at ```i``` are ```[2,3,4,5],[3,4,5],[4,5],[5]``` . Therefore, total would be ```4  which is equal to i-start+1``` 


## Intuition and Approach
Counting subarrays based on a condition is a common question.  How we do this is -- 

**Valid sub-array is a sub-array that has at-least one minK and one maxK.**

As we scan through the array, at each index ``i`` there can be a total ```i-start+1``` subarrays that end at ```i```. Out of this number we need to subtract the total number of invalid subarrays ending at ```i```.
[start is 0 initially, but it changes when we encounter an out of range element]

Total number of invalid subarrays ending at ``i`` is equal to ```i-P+1```  where ``P`` is the position *just after* least of latest seen occurence of minK or maxK.
i.e., ```P = min(lastMin,lastMax)+1``` where ``lastMin`` is the latest occurence of ``minK`` and ``lastMax`` is the latest occurence of ``maxK``.

Therefore it is obvious, that we'll have to maintain the lastMin, lastMax variables.
One last thing is, that if we encounter an element that is out of range completely, then the subarray resets. 
```
if(a[i] if out of range) then {
	start = i+1;
	lastMin = i;
	lastMax = i;
}
```


**Why?**
Because the least of latest occurence of maxK or minK denotes the leftbound of the last valid window .
``[1,2,3,4,5] if minK = 1 and maxK= 5``
then at`` i=4``, total subarrays ending at ``i`` are ``[5],[4,5],[3,4,5],[2,3,4,5],[1,2,3,4,5]``. But out of these 4 are invalid =>`` [5],[4,5],[3,4,5],[2,3,4,5]`` because these don't have ``minK``.
The latest occurence of ``minK`` was at index 0, so all subarrays that end at ``i`` but start after index 0 are invalid.
``[1,2,3,4,5,4,3,1]``
then at ``i=7``, total subarrays total 8 subarrays end at ``i``. But out of these 3 are invalid => ``[4,3,1],[3,1],[1]`` because these don't have`` maxK``.
The latest occurence of ``maxK`` was at index 4, so all subarrays that end at ``i`` but start after index 4 are invalid.
```

a = [1,3,5,2,7,5], minK = 1, maxK = 5
intially,
start = 0
lastMin = -1
lastMax = -1
count = 0

iteration i=0:
a[i] is minK, so lastMin = i
total subarrays at i=0 are i-start+1 = 1
invalid subarrys at i=0 are [i-(min(lastMin,lastMax)+1)+1] = 1 
count += (1-1) i.e., total-invalid
```
count is 0 | start is 0 | lastMin = 0 | lastMax = -1
```
iteration i=1:
total subarrays at i=1 are i-start+1 = 2
invalid subarrys at i=1 are [i-(min(lastMin,lastMax)+1)+1] = 2 
count += (2-2)
```
count is 0 | start is 0 | lastMin = 0 | lastMax = -1
```
iteration i=2:
a[i] is maxK, so lastMax = i
total subarrays at i=2 are i-start+1 = 3
invalid subarrys at i=2 are [i-(min(lastMin,lastMax)+1)+1] = 2 
count += (3-2)
```
count is 1 | start is 0 | lastMin = 0 | lastMax = 2
```
iteration i=3:
total subarrays at i=3 are i-start+1 = 4
invalid subarrys at i=3 are [i-(min(lastMin,lastMax)+1)+1] = 3 
count += (4-3)
```
count is 2 | start is 0 | lastMin = 0 | lastMax = 2 
```
iteration i=4:
a[i] is out of range.
start is i+1 = 5
lastMin = i = 5
lastMax = i = 5
```
count is 2 | start is 5 | lastMin = 5 | lastMax = 5 
```
iteration i=5:
total subarrays at i=5 are i-start+1 = 1
invalid subarrys at i=5 are [i-(min(lastMin,lastMax)+1)+1] = 1 
count += (1-1)
```
count is 2 | start is 5 | lastMin = 5 | lastMax = 5 

## Complexity
Linear time and constant space as we only maintain variables and only traverse the array once.

## Code

```javascript []
const countSubarrays = function (nums, minK, maxK) {
    let lastMin=-1;
    let lastMax=-1;
    let start=0;
    let count=0;
    for(let i=0; i<nums.length; i++){
        if(nums[i]<minK || nums[i]>maxK){
            start = i+1;
            lastMin = i;
            lastMax = i;
            continue;
        }
        if(nums[i] == minK){
            lastMin = i;
        }
        if(nums[i] == maxK){
            lastMax = i;
        }
        valid = (i-start+1);
        invalid = i - (Math.min(lastMin, lastMax) + 1) + 1;
        count+= valid - invalid;
        console.log(start,valid,invalid,count);
      }
    return count;
};
```
```C++ []
long long countSubarrays(vector<int>& nums, int minK, int maxK) {
    int lastMin=-1;
    int lastMax=-1;
    int start=0;
    long long count=0;
    for(int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++){
        if(nums[i]<minK || nums[i]>maxK){
            start = i+1;
            lastMin = i;
            lastMax = i;
            continue;
        }
        if(nums[i] == minK){
            lastMin = i;
        }
        if(nums[i] == maxK){
            lastMax = i;
        }
        int valid = (i-start+1);
        int invalid = i - (min(lastMin, lastMax) + 1) + 1;
        count+= valid - invalid;
      }
    return count;    
 }

```
```Java []
public long countSubarrays(int[] nums, int minK, int maxK) {
    int lastMin=-1;
    int lastMax=-1;
    int start=0;
    long count=0;
    for(int i=0; i<nums.length; i++){
        if(nums[i]<minK || nums[i]>maxK){
            start = i+1;
            lastMin = i;
            lastMax = i;
            continue;
        }
        if(nums[i] == minK){
            lastMin = i;
        }
        if(nums[i] == maxK){
            lastMax = i;
        }
        int valid = (i-start+1);
        int invalid = i - (Math.min(lastMin, lastMax) + 1) + 1;
        count+= valid - invalid;
      }
    return count;   
    }
